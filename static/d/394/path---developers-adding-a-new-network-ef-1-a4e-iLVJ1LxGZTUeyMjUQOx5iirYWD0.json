To make sure your network is well supported, we require the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Must have at least one reliable, working node.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Must be EIP155 compliant with a unique Chain ID this is not used by any other MyCrypto-supported network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Must have a block explorer that can view addresses, transactions, and blocks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should not have a token name that conflicts with a more popular token.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This will break equivalent fiat values and may confuse users. You can check this at <a href=\"https://www.cryptocompare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.cryptocompare.com/</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you meet all of those requirements, you simply need to <a href=\"https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">make a pull request</a> with the following changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a deterministic path (aka dpath) to <code>common/configs/dpath.ts</code> for your network, even if it just uses Ethereum's default path.</li>\n<li>Add at least one node to <code>common/libs/nodes/configs.ts</code>.</li>\n<li>Add your network configuration to <code>common/features/config/networks/static/reducer.ts</code>.</li>\n<li>Add your network's key (matching the key in <code>reducer.ts</code>) to <code>shared/types/network.d.ts</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you'd like to provide users with a direct link to your network without having to select it from the dropdown, you can send a URL like <a href=\"https://mycrypto.com/account?network=%7Bnetwork%7D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mycrypto.com/account?network={network}</a> where <code>{network}</code> is the key from the <code>reducer.ts</code> config.</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/pull/1962/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This commit exemplifies the process described above.</a></p>\n<h2>Adding a Node</h2>\n<p>If you'd only like to add a node to support an existing network, all you need to do is follow step 2 listed above. Nodes are automatically load-balanced based on performance, so your node will automatically get utilized by anyone using the network. Thanks for supporting the ecosystem!</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"developers/adding-a-new-network","file":"developers/adding-a-new-network.md"}}
