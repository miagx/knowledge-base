Please send more funds or switch to a different wallet.\"</code>, it means you do not have enough <strong>ETH</strong> in your account to cover the cost of gas.</p>\n<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) requires gas, and that gas is paid in ETH. You can think of this as a transaction fee.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Send 0.01 ETH to that public address in order to be able to make the transaction.</p>\n<p>A standard transaction (TX) will be <code>21000</code> gas at a gas price of <code>0.00000002 ETH</code>, so the total TX fee will be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>. Sending tokens typically costs <code>50000 gas - 100000 gas</code>, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</p>\n<p>The number displayed in that error message is the amount required to cover the cost of the TX in Wei. Take that number and divide by <code>1000000000000000000</code>. This will give you the amount of Ether you need to send to that account and make the transaction.</p>\n<h2>Related articles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-is-gas\">What is Gas?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-gas-and-transaction-fee-in-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is gas (StackExchange)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/what-is-the-gas-in-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What is gas?
