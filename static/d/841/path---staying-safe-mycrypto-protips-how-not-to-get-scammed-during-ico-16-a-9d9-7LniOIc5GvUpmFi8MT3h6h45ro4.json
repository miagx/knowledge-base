These warn you if you go to a malicious website.</li>\n<li>Did you just get sent a link to a token sale, MyCrypto, EtherDelta, ShapeShift, or eBay? <strong>Don't click it!</strong> Instead, search for that service on Google. Click the top one <strong>that is not an ad.</strong></li>\n<li>You <strong>do not</strong> have to enter your private key for an airdrop. Don't enter your private key on random sites!</li>\n<li>Double-check the URL. Are there any weird characters? Symbols? It is <code>shapshift</code> instead of <code>shapeshift</code>? Or <code>myctypto</code> instead of <code>mycrypto</code>?</li>\n<li>Token sale or exchange? Google the name of the token + \"twitter\"</li>\n<li>Check out the Twitter account. Everything looking good still? Do they still have a verified badge if they had one before?</li>\n<li>Sending to an address? Check out the address on <a href=\"https://etherscan.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherscan</a>. Check for \"scam\" warnings under the comment section.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The screenshots below point out specific things to check to make sure you are interacting with the correct site.</p>\n<h2>1. Use Google instead of clicking links sent to you</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XwiVCSY.jpg\"></p>\n<p>So you received a message, saw a tweet, or whatever about hot new ICO. Don't click. Google the name of the token + \"token contribution,\" \"Ethereum,\" or \"token.\"</p>\n<h2>2. Check the URL. Is it the same as the message received?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8wmJRYg.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Okay ... but how do I know this is the <em>right</em> URL?</p>\n<h2>3. Google the name of the token + \"twitter\"</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cLC6kWK.jpg\"></p>\n<h2>4. Check out the Twitter. Everything looking good still?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EYwqZpL.jpg\"></p>\n<p>On Twitter, check the URL and the USERNAME of the account. Be on the lookout for weird things like _ or capital \"I\"s that look like \"l\"s or \"O\"s that look like \"0\"s. This indicates a scammer.</p>\n<p>Followers, images, tweets, and the name of the Twitter account are cloned by fake accounts. Ignore those.</p>\n<p>If you have followers in common, this is a good sign! The URL they provided matches the URL you were on earlier. So let's get the address ...</p>\n<h2>5. Check out the address on <a href=\"https://etherscan.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherscan</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/nVB3esg.png\"></p>\n<p>... and let's check the comments on Etherscan.</p>\n<p>Does it have any comments? Are they all angry people who had their funds stolen?</p>\n<p>Or is there some extra verification that this is legit? Again, never rely on a single commentâ€”multiple indications of legitimacy are ideal.</p>\n<h2>6. And always make sure you are on the correct MyCrypto</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kIzLh8t.png\"></p>\n<p>Finally, when you go to contribute, make sure you are on a legit version of MyCrypto (<a href=\"https://mycrypto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mycrypto.com/</a>).</p>\n<p>Check the URL. Check the SSL (it should always say MyCrypto, Inc [US]).</p>\n<p>Check the address. Check the identicon (the blob of colors that corresponds to your address. It is an easy way to see whether the address is consistent across multiple places).</p>\n<p>In this case, district0x's is kinda pinky-yellow and the address starts with 0xF80.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1OvTydO.jpg\"></p>\n<p>Sweetness.</p>\n<p>Oh, and now the URL on MyCrypto displays on load and node change. This is another easy reminder to let you know if you are on a scam site.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FeUNqAY.png\"></p>\n<h3>Related articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/i-got-sloppy-i-got-scammed-10e00ac0905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\"I Got Sloppy, I Got Scammed\"</a></li>\n</ul>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"staying-safe/mycrypto-protips-how-not-to-get-scammed-during-ico","file":"staying-safe/mycrypto-protips-how-not-to-get-scammed-during-ico.md"}}
