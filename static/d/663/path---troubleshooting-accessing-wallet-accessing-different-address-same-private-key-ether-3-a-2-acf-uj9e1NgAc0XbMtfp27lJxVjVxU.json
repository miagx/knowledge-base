Essentially, you need to do the same thing each time you open your wallet.</p>\n<p>If you saved another version (e.g, the UTC / Keystore file), it may also be worth testing that as well.</p>\n<p>You had to unlock your wallet in order to obtain your address from MyCrypto. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to not have saved this file and unlocked it correctly. Think back and repeat the exact steps you made when you unlocked it. Which private key type did you use to access that address?</p>\n<p>If you think you may have mistyped a private key, here is a snippet that will help you check each letter for a mistype. Keep in mind, this assumes you mistyped a single character.
