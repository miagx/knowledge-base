This ensures that you are using the real MyCrypto desktop application and not one that has been tampered with by someone else.</p>\n<p>To begin, download the desktop application and the signed checksums (<code>checksums.txt.gpg</code>) from <a href=\"https://download.mycrypto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download.mycrypto.com</a> and place both files in a folder somewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: Always check for the green <strong>\"MyCrypto, Inc.\" SSL certificate</strong> your browser before downloading and do not continue if the SSL certificate is missing or you see a SSL warning.</p>\n<p>Verifying the checksums is platform-specific, so follow the instructions that apply to you. Instructions are available for Windows, macOS and Linux.</p>\n<h2>Windows</h2>\n<h3>1. Download and install gpg4win</h3>\n<p>To verify the signature of the checksums file, you need <a href=\"https://gpg4win.org/get-gpg4win.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">gpg4win</a>. In the installer, it is not necessary to select any of the optional options.</p>\n<h3>2. Open a command prompt</h3>\n<p>In the folder with the MyCrypto application and the checksums.txt.gpg file, open a PowerShell command prompt by holding shift and right clicking. Then click \"Open PowerShell here\".</p>\n<h3>3. Import the signing GPG key</h3>\n<p>To import the signing GPG key, run the following command in PowerShell:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-powershell\">> Invoke-RestMethod https://keybase.io/tayvano/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"public key from Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>\" imported.</p>\n<h3>4. Checking the checksums signature</h3>\n<p>To check the signature of the <code>checksums.txt.gpg</code> file, you have to run the following command in PowerShell:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-powershell\">> gpg --output checksums.txt --decrypt checksums.txt.gpg\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"Good signature from 'Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>'\". It will also create a <code>checksums.txt</code> file with the checksums of the application.</p>\n<h3>5. Hashing the application</h3>\n<p>The last step is to hash the application and check the hash to see if it matches with the one in the <code>checksums.txt</code> file. To do this, run the following command in PowerShell:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-powershell\">> CertUtil -hashFile windows_VERSION_MyCrypto.exe SHA256\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace the filename (windows<em>VERSION</em>MyCrypto.exe) with the actual filename of the file you downloaded. You should see \"SHA256 hash of windows<em>VERSION</em>MyCrypto.exe:\" with the hash below. Open the <code>checksums.txt</code> file and check if the hash matches with the one in the file.</p>\n<h2>macOS</h2>\n<h3>1. Download and install curl and gpg</h3>\n<p>To download the signing GPG key, which is used to verify that the checksums were signed by MyCrypto, you need curl. <strong>Usually curl is already available on your system.</strong> You can test this by opening a terminal and running <code>curl --help</code>. If it is not installed yet, the easiest way to install curl is by using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Homebrew</a>. Open a terminal and run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ brew install curl\n</code></pre>\n<p>You also have to install gpg from <a href=\"https://gpgtools.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. After installation, you don't have to open the application.</p>\n<h3>2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder</h3>\n<p>Open a terminal and use the following command to go to the folder with the MyCrypto files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd /path/to/folder\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace '/path/to/folder' with the actual path of the files.</p>\n<h3>3. Import the signing GPG key</h3>\n<p>To import the signing GPG key, run the following command in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ curl https://keybase.io/tayvano/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"public key from Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>\" imported.</p>\n<h3>4. Checking the checksums signature</h3>\n<p>To check the signature of the <code>checksums.txt.gpg</code> file, you have to run the following command in a terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ gpg --output checksums.txt --decrypt checksums.txt.gpg\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"Good signature from 'Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>'\". It will also create a <code>checksums.txt</code> file with the checksums of the application.</p>\n<h3>5. Hashing the application</h3>\n<p>The last step is to hash the application and check the hash to see if it matches with the one in the <code>checksums.txt</code> file. To do this, run the following command in a terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ shasum -a 256 mac_VERSION_MyCrypto.dmg\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace the filename (mac<em>VERSION</em>MyCrypto.dmg) with the actual filename of the file you downloaded. You should see the hash. Open the <code>checksums.txt</code> file and check if the hash matches with the one in the file.</p>\n<h2>Linux</h2>\n<h3>1. Download and install curl and gpg</h3>\n<p>To download the signing GPG key, which is used to verify that the checksums were signed by MyCrypto, you need curl. <strong>Usually curl and gpg are already available on your system.</strong> You can test this by opening a terminal and running <code>curl --help</code> and <code>gpg --help</code>. If either one is not installed yet, you have to install it using the package manager of your specific Linux distro.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are on Debian, Ubuntu or a similar distro:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ apt-get install curl gnupg\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you are on Arch Linux or a similar distro:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ pacman -S curl gnupg\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you are on CentOS or a similar distro:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ yum install curl gnupg\n</code></pre>\n<h3>2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder</h3>\n<p>Open a terminal and use the following command to go to the folder with the MyCrypto files:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ cd /path/to/folder\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace '/path/to/folder' with the actual path of the files.</p>\n<h3>3. Import the signing GPG key</h3>\n<p>To import the signing GPG key, run the following command in the terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ curl https://keybase.io/tayvano/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"public key from Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>\" imported.</p>\n<h3>4. Checking the checksums signature</h3>\n<p>To check the signature of the <code>checksums.txt.gpg</code> file, you have to run the following command in a terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ gpg --output checksums.txt --decrypt checksums.txt.gpg\n</code></pre>\n<p>If all goes well, you should see \"Good signature from 'Taylor &#x3C;tayvano [at] gmail.com>'\". It will also create a <code>checksums.txt</code> file with the checksums of the application.</p>\n<h3>5. Hashing the application</h3>\n<p>The last step is to hash the application and check the hash to see if it matches with the one in the <code>checksums.txt</code> file. To do this, run the following command in a terminal:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ sha256sum linux_PLATFORM_VERSION_MyCrypto.AppImage\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure to replace the filename (linux<em>PLATFORM</em>VERSION_MyCrypto.AppImage) with the actual filename of the file you downloaded. You should see the hash. Open the <code>checksums.txt</code> file and check if the hash matches with the one in the file.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app","file":"staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app.md"}}
