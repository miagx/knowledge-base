You can find the start auction TX by typing in your name on <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=yourname.eth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherscan</a> and clicking on the bottom-most TX hash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you find this, copy and paste the value in the \"Input Data\" into a text document &#x26; remove the \"MethodId:\" and \"[0]:\" so that it looks like this: <code>0xce92dced69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65</code>.</p>\n<h2>2.

You want compare the string you copied earlier ( <code>0xce92dced69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65</code>) to the string shown under <strong>\"New Bid Data\"</strong>.</p>\n<h2>3. Try alternate values</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Try entering 0.01, 0.1, 1 and any other values you have bid on other auctions under \"Amount you Bid (ETH)\".</li>\n<li>Check the amount that you sent with your bid (the amount shown that you sent in your transaction from step 1)</li>\n<li>Look through your transaction history or any information you have saved for other auctions, and try using those values at the amount you bid.</li>\n<li>Check again to make sure that you for sure sent from the address you entered.</li>\n<li>Try changing secrets to other secrets for other auctions. Did you change the secret instead of using the pre-filled one? Try entering common words and phrases you may have used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4. Reveal your bid</h2>\n<p>Once you match the string successfully, you can reveal your bid manually using this exact information.</p>\n<p>Copy the \"Reveal Data\" string and go to <a href=\"https://mycrypto.com/account\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MyCrypto</a> and unlock the wallet for the address that you placed the bid on.

Generate and sign your transaction</h2>\n<p>Click your TX hash after you send it. Ensure there are no errors (you may have to refresh a few times.)</p>\n<p>Then, in a new tab, go to <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=yourname.eth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherscan</a> and type in the name you bid on. Ensure that you see a very recent transaction from your address with \"Unseal Bid\" next to it.</p>\n<p><strong>You should probably also save the finalize data. This will allow you to easily finalize the transaction in a few days.</strong></p>\n<h2>Related articles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/ens/brute-forcing-secret-word-phrases\">What to do if you forgot to save your secret key.</a></li>\n</ul>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"troubleshooting/ens/ens-debugging-a-bad-instruction-reveal","file":"troubleshooting/ens/ens-debugging-a-bad-instruction-reveal.md"}}
