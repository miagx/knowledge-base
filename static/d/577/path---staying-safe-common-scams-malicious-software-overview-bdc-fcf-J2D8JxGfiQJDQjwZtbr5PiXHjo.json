Malicious software can come in many forms, from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keyloggers</a> to <a href=\"http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/clipboard-hijack-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clipboard Hijackers</a> to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_access_trojan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RATs</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trojans</a>.</p>\n<p>This malware can be used to steal your funds by taking your private keys (the access key to your public address) and transferring your funds away.</p>\n<h3>How can I mitigate this?</h3>\n<p>To mitigate this, users should always practice safe computing habits. Here are some useful tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not download files from e-mail or websites that you don't know or trust.</li>\n<li>Get in the habit of running periodic antivirus/antimalware scans on your computer.</li>\n<li>Do not use public networks for anything related to cryptocurrency. Public networks expose your browsing habits to anyone on the network listening for them.</li>\n<li>Download an antivirus and firewall software for your computer.</li>\n<li>Do not allow others to have unmonitored access to your computer.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h3>Keyloggers</h3>\n<p>Keyloggers can be used to record your private keys/keystore passwords/mnemonic phrases.</p>\n<h3>Clipboard Hijackers</h3>\n<p>Clipboard Hijackers can be used to for public key replacement which is an attack in which a bad actor's malware watches your clipboard and when it sees strings that resemble Ethereum, Bitcoin, Monero, or Litecoin public keys, it replaces the copied public key with their own, previously-specified public key. That way, when you go to paste it into a send box to send your funds to someone or some organization, you actually end up sending to the attacker.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/03/unit42-sure-ill-take-new-combojack-malware-alters-clipboards-steal-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ComboJack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cryptoshuffler-bitcoin-stealer/19976/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cryptoshuffler</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>If you don't understand any of the terms in this article, please try referencing our <a href=\"/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/a-glossary-of-common-terms-in-the-ethereum-crypto-space\">Ethereum Glossary</a>.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"staying-safe/common-scams/malicious-software-overview","file":"staying-safe/common-scams/malicious-software-overview.md"}}
