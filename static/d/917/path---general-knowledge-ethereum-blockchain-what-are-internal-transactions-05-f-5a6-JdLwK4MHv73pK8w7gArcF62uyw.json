They are also not included directly in the blockchain; they are value transfers that were initiated by executing a smart contract (smart contract Ether or token transfer).</p>\n<p>Certain Ether and token transfers require calling a smart contract to perform the action. These show up as internal transactions and are not indicated in the main ETH transaction history on etherscan.io. There should be a separate tab for \"Internal Transactions\" when you look up your wallet address in <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">etherscan.io</a>.</p>\n<p>When withdrawing, you need to make sure that the receiving address supports smart contracts, like MyCrypto.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KRrv6r8.jpg\"></p>\n<p>If you can't see your transaction, please take a look at our article <a href=\"/troubleshooting/sending/transactions-not-showing-or-pending\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you see that your transaction was successful but you can't see the tokens in your account, please refer to our article about <a href=\"/how-to/tokens/showing-and-loading-tokens\">adding a custom token to your MyCrypto Interface here</a>.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-are-internal-transactions","file":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/what-are-internal-transactions.md"}}
