If you use the checksummed version and mistype it, it will tell you that it's an invalid address.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we warn you when your address is not checksummed. You can still send to it without issue but you should double-check the address before doing so, <em>especially</em> if you hand typed it.</p>\n<p>If you are sending to one of your own wallets, you can save the checksummed address via the \"View Wallet Info\" page and copy the address displayed there.</p>\n<p>Both addresses are exactly the same in how they work and can access your funds, except for the uppercase vs lowercase letters. Capitalization simply means the address has a checksum.</p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/ethereum-address-has-uppercase-and-lowercase-letters","file":"general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain/ethereum-address-has-uppercase-and-lowercase-letters.md"}}
