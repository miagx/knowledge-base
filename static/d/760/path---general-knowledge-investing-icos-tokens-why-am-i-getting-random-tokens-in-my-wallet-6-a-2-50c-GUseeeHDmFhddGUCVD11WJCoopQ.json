This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.</p>\n<p>The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ethereum you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.</p>\n<p>That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, this means that everyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens.
