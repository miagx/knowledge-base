Some people prefer to have different wallets. Some people have a smaller \"hot\" wallet that is kept on their computer with small amounts of the coins they hold while keeping a majority of their funds in a cold-storage wallet.</p>\n<p>The only thing to keep in mind is that in order to send tokens, you must also have a small amount (&#x3C;0.1 ETH) in your account to cover the cost of gas.
