Checksummed addresses are meant to help prevent users from sending transactions to the wrong address.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of Ethereum addresses: those that contain uppercase letters and those that don't:</p>\n<p><code>0x4bbeeb066ed09b7aed07bf39eee0460dfa261520</code></p>\n<p><code>0x4bbeEB066eD09B7AEd07bF39EEe0460DFa261520</code></p>\n<p>Both addresses are exactly the same, except for the uppercase vs lowercase letters. Capitalization simply means the address has a checksum. Both will work exactly the same and have your funds.</p>\n<p>The one that is all lowercase is \"not checksummed,\" meaning that you could mistype a letter or number. If you mistype the address and send the transaction, your ETH will be gone forever.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you use the checksummed version of an address and mistype it, it will tell you that it's an invalid address when you go to submit the transaction.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we warn you when your address is not checksummed. You are still free to send funds to it, but you should double-check the address before doing so, <em>especially</em> if you hand-typed it.</p>\n<p>If you are sending funds to one of your own wallets, you can save the checksummed address via the <a href=\"https://mycrypto.com/account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Send &#x26; Receive</a> page and copy the address displayed there.</p>\n<p><strong>To help others implement best practices, make sure to contact your favorite Ethereum organizations about adopting this standard to help protect their users (YOU!).</strong></p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"troubleshooting/sending/not-checksummed-shows-when-i-enter-an-address","file":"troubleshooting/sending/not-checksummed-shows-when-i-enter-an-address.md"}}
