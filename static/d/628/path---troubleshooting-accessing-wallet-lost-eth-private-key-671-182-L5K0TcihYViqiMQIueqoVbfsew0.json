We are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use MyCrypto.

We recommend the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do a full search of your computer for \"UTC--\" and see if the private key shows up. </li>\n<li>Do a full search of your computer for your address <em>without</em> the 0x at the beginning.</li>\n<li>If you know <em>when</em> you created it, look through all files during that time period for any documents or screenshots.</li>\n<li>Generate a new wallet via <a href=\"https://mycrypto.com/generate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mycrypto.com/generate</a> and take a look at the different options you may have downloaded or saved. Sometimes that can jog your memory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the future, we highly recommend you print out a paper version of your wallet and keep it in multiple physical locations. <a href=\"/how-to/backup-restore/how-to-save-back-up-your-wallet\">You can read more about how to safely back up your wallet here.</a></p>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"troubleshooting/accessing-wallet/lost-eth-private-key","file":"troubleshooting/accessing-wallet/lost-eth-private-key.md"}}
