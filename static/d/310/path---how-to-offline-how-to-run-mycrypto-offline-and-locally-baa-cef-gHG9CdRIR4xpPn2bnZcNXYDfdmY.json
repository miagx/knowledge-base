The computer should have no internet connection. You can generate a wallet completely offline and send transactions from the \"View &#x26; Send\" page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://download.mycrypto.com/images/mac.png\"></p>\n<h3>Downloading and installing</h3>\n<p>In order to set up your local MyCrypto, start off by downloading the latest release of the desktop application <a href=\"https://download.mycrypto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, be sure that you see the green \"MyCrypto, Inc [US]\" bar in the URL bar. <a href=\"/troubleshooting/cannot-see-the-extended-validation-certificate\">Don't see it?</a> Additionally, check the signed checksums. We made a guide about verifying the authenticity of the desktop app <a href=\"/staying-safe/verifying-authenticity-of-desktop-app\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9deFpcy.png\"></p>\n<p>Move the downloaded executable to a USB stick or something similar, in order to move it to your offline computer. Plug the USB stick into your offline computer and move the executable to a place that you can easily find on your offline computer.</p>\n<h3>Running the application</h3>\n<p>To open the MyCrypto application, double-click the executable. This should open up a new window on your computer with the local version of MyCrypto running. You will get a warning that says it is unable to connect to the network, but this is completely normal. You won't be able to see your Ether or token balance through your local MyCrypto, but you can still use <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherscan</a> or <a href=\"https://www.etherchain.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Etherchain</a> to see your balance.</p>\n<p>The application will let you know in case there is a new update available. To update, simply download the newest version on <a href=\"https://download.mycrypto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download.mycrypto.com</a>, and check that the certificate in the URL bar is correct (MyCrypto, Inc [US]).</p>\n<h3>Related articles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/sending/how-to-make-an-offline-transaction\">How To Make An Offline Transaction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/how-to/accessing-wallet/how-to-check-the-balance-of-your-account\">Checking the Balance of Your Account</a></li>\n</ul>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"how-to/offline/how-to-run-mycrypto-offline-and-locally","file":"how-to/offline/how-to-run-mycrypto-offline-and-locally.md"}}
