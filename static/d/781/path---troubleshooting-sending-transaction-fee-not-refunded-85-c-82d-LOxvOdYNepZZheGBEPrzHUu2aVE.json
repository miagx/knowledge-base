Ether (ETH) is the fuel for that network. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in <code>Gas</code> and gas is paid in <code>ETH</code>.</p>\n<p>You are paying for the <em>computation</em>, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction <em>(compute)</em> and therefore you must pay for that computation just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>\n<p>You can see your TX fee (<code>gas limit</code> * <code>gas price</code>) in ETH &#x26; USD when you search for your transaction on <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd0790ea27df12a3b4ce026ee2ffc7402c30cf7d988eef17b5c1d899c52a70b67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">etherscan.io</a>.</p>\n<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a transaction fee that MyCrypto, or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to miners for mining transactions, putting them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>\n<h2>Related articles</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/general-knowledge/ethereum-blockchain\">General info about the Ethereum blockchain</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/troubleshooting/sending/transaction-failed-out-of-gas\">Transaction failed: Out of gas</a></li>\n</ul>"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"troubleshooting/sending/transaction-fee-not-refunded","file":"troubleshooting/sending/transaction-fee-not-refunded.md"}}
