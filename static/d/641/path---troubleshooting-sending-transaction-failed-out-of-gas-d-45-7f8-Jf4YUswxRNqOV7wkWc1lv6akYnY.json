You can think of this as a transaction fee. The more computational effort a transaction takes, the more gas you need.</p>\n<p>MyCrypto estimates how much gas you will need - but there may be an occasional technical error.</p>\n<h2>How to solve</h2>\n<p>Manually increasing the \"Gas Limit.\" First, try doubling the amount of gas that MyCrypto estimates and sending again.</p>\n<p>Any excess gas will be returned to you, so you could even triple or quadruple it.</p>\n<p>We are always trying to improve how we estimate gas as contracts become more complex. However, sometimes we still get it wrong.
